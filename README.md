[schedule]: course

# Purpose

This repository exists solely to store curriculum materials.

It does not follow "presentation logic", i.e. materials are not organized according to the day on which they are presented.

Check out the [**Course Schedule**][schedule] for chronologically-organized READMEs linking to curriculum materials.

# Organization

Materials are organized by topic and then type.

* **Topics**
	* [Ruby][ruby]
	* [SQL][sql]
	* [Rails][rails]
	* [HTML/CSS][html-css]
	* [Javascript][js]
	* [React][react]
	* [Full-Stack Project][full-stack-project]

* **Types**   
	* **Readings**: markdown files for teaching material.   
	* **Projects**: Work done in class.
		* Each project should have its own folder holding instructions (as a README), skeleton, solution, etc.
	* **Homeworks**: Work done outside of class.
	* **Demos**: Self-contained demonstrations requiring no student input.
	* **Assets**: Images, etc. Roughly miscellaneous.

**Note:** There is no "Solutions" folder: solutions should live in the folders of their respective projects (e.g. javascript/projects/asteroids/solution).

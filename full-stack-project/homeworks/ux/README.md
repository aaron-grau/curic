# JotItDown

This exercise will help you practice creating usable, visually pleasing
layouts around existing content.

Begin by downloading the [skeleton][skeleton].

Apply the UX concepts you know to create CSS layouts for the `index.html` and
`splash.html` pages of a note-taking app. You will need to reorganize the
information, apply relevant markup, and add styling.

The splash page should clearly introduce the site's purpose to a user and direct them to sign up / sign in / sign out. You will likely want to style a nav bar.

The index page should probably include at least a nav bar, a footer, form styles, and container styles for list and item content.

Tips:
* Keep visual hierarchy and web layout conventions in mind.
* Don't forget to add signifiers!
* If you feel stuck, refer to existing note-taking apps for inspiration.

Don't worry about making your site dynamic: focus on just representing one
"state" for the materials presented. For example, if you decide that clicking a
list item should change the content of the main section, just show how the page
would look if that one item had already been clicked.

When you're done, compare your work against [some real examples][screenshots].

# Bonus

- Make sure your site meets [web-accessibility standards][standards].
- Implement a color scheme for your site. You scheme should have 3 colors:
background, main, and accent. You can get inspiration from [colourlovers][colors].
- Add custom [fonts][fonts]. You should have a header font and a body font.

# React SyntheticEvents

Event handling in the React world is very convenient and easy. Have a
second look at the `input` example above. We have registered an event
`onChange` of the `input`. We did this by passing in a prop with the
key `onChange`. The value for this must be a callback that will be
executed when the event occurs. Every event I can think of is supported.
A comprehensive list is [available here][react-events].

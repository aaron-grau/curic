Facebook has put together a good Flux example using the classic "Todo List"
project. Walk through the code and make sure you understand deeply what each
piece of the Flux architecture is doing and how they relate to one another.

Don't worry about building this up from scratch --- instead, run the 
[completed example][example-link] (instructions [here][instructions-link]). 
This means you can ignore the bit about `react-boilerplate` and start at 
**Source Code Structure**. In order to better understand the code in the 
dispatcher, read through the [mdn documentation][mdn-promises], but focus your
energy more on understanding the React/Flux here.

You can find the tutorial [here][flux-todo-tutorial].

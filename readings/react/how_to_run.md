* clone this repo: https://github.com/facebook/flux
* navigate to the `examples` folder
* enter the `flux-todomvc` directory
* run `npm install` to install all the node packages needed to run this
  project
* run `npm start`, this will start `watchify` which will automatically
  build `bundle.js` every time any of the files changes
* now you should be able to just open `index.html` in the browser
